# Unix-like terminal made in Godot 3.4
This program imitates the behavior of a unix command line interface.

You can perform actions over the directory tree, such as creating new directories and files, renaming them, moving them, deleting them from the tree, and more.

Be aware that this program isn't a 1:1 unix CLI clone, hence many features that you'd normally see in a real unix CLI won't be available (pipes, wildcards, package managers, etc.)

Happy Hacking!
